# Unsupervised-Learning
  Clustering - which groups data together based on similarities
  Dimensionality Reduction - which condenses a large number of features into a (usually much) smaller set of features

## Clustering
   basic meaning
   how the k-means algorithm works
   find groupings of similar movies
	
## Hierarchical and Density Based Clustering
   density based 'closeness' measures
   how this can be used in traffic classification
   anomaly detection - finding points that aren't like others in your dataset
	 
## Gaussian Mixture Models and Cluster Validation
   gaussian mixture models
   last of the clustering algorithms you will learn before moving to matrix decomposition methods

## Principal Component Analysis
   one of the most popular decomposition methods available today
   learn how matrix decomposition methods work conceptually
   apply principal component analysis to images of handwritten digits to reduce the dimensionality of these images
	
## Random Projection and Independent Component Analysis
   independent component analysis
   how this method can pull apart audio related to a piano, cello, and television that has been overlaid in the same file
