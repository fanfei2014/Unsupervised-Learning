# Unsupervised-Learning

## Clustering
  understand of what clustering your data means
	how the k-means algorithm works
	find groupings of similar movies
	
## Hierarchical and Density Based Clustering
   density based 'closeness' measures
	 how this can be used in traffic classification
	 anomaly detection - finding points that aren't like others in your dataset
	 
## Gaussian Mixture Models and Cluster Validation
  gaussian mixture models
	last of the clustering algorithms you will learn before moving to matrix decomposition methods

## Principal Component Analysis
  one of the most popular decomposition methods available today
	learn how matrix decomposition methods work conceptually
	apply principal component analysis to images of handwritten digits to reduce the dimensionality of these images
	
## Random Projection and Independent Component Analysis
  Independent component analysis
	how this method can pull apart audio related to a piano, cello, and television that has been overlaid in the same file
